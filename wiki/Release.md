Release Roadmap
===============

Roadmaps and Release schedules just don't work.  So, what is the purpose of 
this page?  It shows what is planned but not the when.

To read and understand this roadmap, know that each bullet item is a 
`keyword` that relates to a category in the \ref todo page.

A release will have one or more of these categories completed.  What will be 
in the next release?  Look no further than the order of the __Future 
Release__ list.  The item at the top of the list will be worked on first.
